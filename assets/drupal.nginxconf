  # In Drupal 8, we must also match new paths where the '.php' appears in
  # the middle, such as update.php/selection. The rule we use is strict,
  # and only allows this pattern with the update.php front controller.
  # This allows legacy path aliases in the form of
  # blog/index.php/legacy-path to continue to route to Drupal nodes. If
  # you do not have any paths like that, then you might prefer to use a
  # laxer rule, such as:
  #   location ~ \.php(/|$) {
  # The laxer rule will continue to work if Drupal uses this new URL
  # pattern with front controllers other than update.php in a future
  # release.
